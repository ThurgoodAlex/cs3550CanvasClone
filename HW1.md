[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to write HTML, I've written a little bit but never actually have structered multipel webpages and how each tags work together to shape up the page before, so I thought that was super interesting to learn.

The hardest thing in this assignment was trying to figure out super fine details such as validating HTML. It wasn't necessarily the hardest, but the validator was giving errors for things that were okay, such as not including the html tag so I wasnt sure whether to listen to the validator or go off the assignment instructions.
